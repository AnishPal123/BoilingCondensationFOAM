## Information 

A new field variable Cc_mod is introduced to modulate condensation strength. The effective accommodation coefficient used in the condensation model is:

𝐶oeffC_eff = Cc_mod×CoeffC

To enforce near-complete vapor return, set Cc_mod to a very large value, or define a localized region near the top wall with very high Cc_mod, so that any vapor reaching the top boundary condenses back into the domain
